# Leaf Mask Data Generation

We found it during previous examples working with this data that the `leaf` and `leafscan` content types
led to the highest quality returns from the system.  This repository is designed to create COCO-type masks
to train the Mask R-CNN (either TensorFlow or PyTorch).  Leaf mask creation is designed to be the first step
of a plant identification process.
